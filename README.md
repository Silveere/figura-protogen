# Figura Protogen
This is my personal avatar for
[Figura](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-The-Moon/FiguraRewriteRewrite), a
Minecraft mod that allows for fully customizable avatars. This avatar is a
vanilla-style avatar with minor enhancements such as emissive textures, a tail,
and hurt animations.

I originally wrote this avatar for the old version of Figura, and I am
currently in the process of rewriting it for the current Figura version. <img src="https://ipv4.games/claim?name=protogen.io" style="display: hidden;" alt="" class="ipv4g" />
